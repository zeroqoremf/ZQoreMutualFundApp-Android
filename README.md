## About

This is the Android mobile application for the ZQore Mutual Fund platform.

- **Fund Detail View:** Provides detailed information for individual mutual fund holdings (ISIN, Current Value, Units, NAVs, Last Updated).
- **Bottom Navigation:** Seamless navigation between Dashboard, Portfolio (placeholder), Transactions (placeholder), and Menu (placeholder).

Planned features include:
- User Authentication (Login/Logout)
- Real-time NAV updates
- Transaction history
- Portfolio performance charts
- Investment/Redemption functionalities

## Architecture

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** For clean separation of concerns and testability.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin:** Primary programming language.
- **Android Jetpack:**
    - **Navigation Component:** For app navigation.

- **Retrofit / Ktor Client:** (Placeholder for future network calls)
- **Coroutines:** For asynchronous programming.
- **Git:** Version control.
- **GitHub:** Repository hosting (zeroqoremf organization).
